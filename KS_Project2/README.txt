submission for 470 project.
v.09

A working wordle site created via React+ javascript to be played in a HTML page.
everything has full functionality but My remaining rows were off at the start of loading the site, I.E. the
code given to me would start me with 6 rows, but upon the first guess, would go to 7 rows, As a alternative.
I gave the remaining rows a -1 in it's calculation so I instead started with 5 rows, and upon the first guess,
would go to the correct 6.
